## Software Design Project - 2022

### Overview

In this group project groups were tasked to design and implement software for monitoring real time data on greenhouse gases, and comparing current data with historical data.

The project work was done in groups of 4.
My responsibility was helping with creating the initial Figma prototype and in the implementation phase I worked on the backend API functionalities.

### Four main use cases for the group project were:

- Monitoring real-time data from SMEAR API. The user can select different variables and choose what is shown.

- Getting historical values from STATFI API. The user can see a visualization of historical data on greenhouse gases based on the selected variable (dataset and time period).

- Comparing the current situation to history. The user can combine data from both APIs side by side and compare current values with historical data.

- Breaking down averages. User is able to choose SMEAR data from the given year to see how the trend of CO2 evolves.

### Instructions

The program can be run with Qt by configuring the SoftwareDesignProject.pro file found in SoftwareDesignProject/

- Qt charts required.

More detailed description about the implementation etc. can be seen from the documentation PDF file.
